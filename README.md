# useful-config-files
Some useful config files that I use.
## init.el
This is the emacs config file that I use, and I don't want to lose it.
## total-lines.sh
This just counts the total lines in a repo (because I am curious and can't remember the command).
## install-programs.sh
This is a running install script of things that I like to have pre-installed.
